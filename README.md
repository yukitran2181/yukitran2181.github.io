# WELCOME TO MY PROFILE 👋👋👋

Hi everyone! I'm Yuki, a person who loves telling stories beyond many complex numbers. 

I have many years of experience working with different industries and business operations problems. In previous roles, I used my detailed analysis of customer, sales, and marketing data to create meaningful reports that helped stakeholders understand our customers and optimize sales operations.

In line with my career aspirations, I am eager to challenge myself with data in a variety of fields, such as banking, retail, and logistics. I am also interested in exploring exercises related to prediction using machine learning.

Moreover, I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
