# WELCOME TO MY PROFILE üëãüëãüëã

Hi everyone! I'm Yuki, a person who loves telling stories beyond many complex numbers. 

I have many years of experience working with different industries and business operations problems. In previous roles, I used my detailed analysis of manufacturing data to find out the bottle neck that helped stakeholders understand how to increase productivity without the thinking of cutting down.

In line with my career aspirations, I am eager to challenge myself with data in these fields: education, retail, and manufacturing. I am also interested in exploring problems related to behavioral psychology.

Moreover, I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

  üí¨ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help.
